<h1>Ultimate Kitchen Companion Chatbot</h1>
Here you will find all of the scripts that I am using to train the ultimate kitchen companion in the form of an AI chatbot. This bot will be able to suggest recipes based
on myriad factors such as taste, ethnicity, type, caloric content and more! Think, "I'd like a recipe for an Indian dish that isn't too spicy and has under 400 calories."
<h2>Included Scripts and their Functions</h2>
<h3>tr-eval-split.py</h3>
This script takes a .csv file and splits it into two sets, one for evaluation (30%) and one for training (70%). This script is easily modular for any type of input file.
