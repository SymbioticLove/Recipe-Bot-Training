<h1>Ultimate Kitchen Companion AI</h1>
Here you will find all of the scripts that I am using to train the ultimate kitchen companion in the form of an AI chatbot. This bot will be able to suggest recipes based on myriad factors such as taste, ethnicity, type, caloric content and more! Think, "I'd like a recipe for an Indian dish that isn't too spicy and has under 400 calories."
<h2>6/25 Update</h2>
Leaps and bounds have been made this week. The scripts are now combined into a single script capable of training an AI using .csv datasets (though, this could be modified to use any type of file) and an NLP model. The checkpoint and early_stopping callbacks ensure that only the best model from testing is saved and that the training is stopped if there is no improvement for 5 epochs, preventing overfitting and diminishing returns. The finalized files are saved as an .h5 file called "nlp-pretrain" so it can be interacted with or built upon further. The repository files are now fully packaged for v1.0 distribution and with light modifications, can be used to train an AI with an NLP model.
